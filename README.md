# Train Cat & Dog Tensorflow Classification Neural Network Model

Train binary classification neural network model using Tensorflow Keras in 3 stages:
1. Basic Level: build basic Tensorflow NN model
2. Intermediate Level: add more advanced layers in basic model to decrease overfitting (i.e. ReduceLROnPlateau, EarlyStopping, BatchNormalization)
3. High Level: use VGG16 model to get fantastic result with 98% accuracy
